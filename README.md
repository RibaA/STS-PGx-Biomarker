# Biomarker Discovery in Soft Tissue Sarcoma (STS) Using Pharmacogenomics Data

This repository supports a project focused on identifying predictive biomarkers in soft tissue sarcoma (STS) through the integration of pharmacogenomics data including cell line and tumor patient and computational approaches. The goal is to better understand drug response mechanisms and identify candidate genes or signatures relevant for STS treatment.

🔍 Overview
STS-PGx-Biomarker aims to:

- Integrates drug response profiles with RNA data

- Focused on STS cell lines from public pharmacogenomic datasets (e.g., GDSC, CTRP, CCLE, and NCI-sarcoma)

- Applies statistical and computatiopnal to identify predictive biomarkers
